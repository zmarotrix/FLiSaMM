## Usage Guide

Upon first launch, the application will attempt to automatically locate your `FANTASY LIFE i` game directory. If it cannot, you will be prompted to select it manually.

### Save Management

The "Save Management" tab is designed to handle all your game saves.

#### Save Profiles

The top row of tabs (e.g., "Steam", "Online-Fix", "Goldberg") represents different save *profiles* or locations on your system. Each profile manages its own set of save slots independently.

#### Save Slots

The left panel lists your "Save Slots". Each slot is an independent container for a save game.

*   **Creating a New Empty Slot:** Click `[ + ] Create New Empty Slot`. You'll be prompted to name it.
*   **Renaming a Slot:** Select a slot, then click "Rename Slot".
*   **Deleting a Slot:** Right-click on a slot and choose "Delete". This will permanently remove the slot and all its backups.

#### Active Save (`[LOADED]`)

When you select a save slot, the top section of the right panel displays information about its "Active Save". This represents the most recent state of that slot.

*   When you load a slot or restore a backup, its "Active Save" becomes the live `gamedata.bin` file that the game uses.
*   If a slot's Active Save is currently loaded by the game, it will show `[LOADED]` next to its name in the slot list, and the Active Save panel will have a blue border.
*   **Loading a Slot's Active Save:** Select a slot, then click "Load Slot" on the left panel.
    *   If the slot is empty (newly created), the application will clear the game's save directory. You must then launch the game to create a new save file for this slot.
    *   If the slot contains an existing Active Save, it will be loaded.

#### Manual Backups

The main section of the right panel, "Manual Backups", lists all the specific snapshots you've created for the selected save slot.

*   **Creating a New Backup:** Select a loaded slot, then click "Create New Backup". It will automatically be named sequentially (e.g., "Backup - 0001").
*   **Loading a Backup:** Select a backup in the list, then click "Load". You will be prompted to save your current game progress before the backup overwrites it.
*   **Renaming a Backup:** Select a backup in the list, then click "Rename Backup".
*   **Deleting a Backup:** Select a backup in the list, then click "Delete Backup".

#### Actions: Load Slot, Create/Rename/Delete/Copy Slot/Backup

*   **Load Slot:** Loads the Active Save for the selected slot.
*   **Create New Empty Slot:** Creates a new, blank save slot.
*   **Rename Slot:** Renames the selected save slot.
*   **Delete Slot:** Permanently deletes the selected slot and all its data.
*   **Copy Slot to...:** Copies the selected slot (including its Active Save and all Manual Backups) to another save profile. You will choose the destination from a list of detected save locations.
*   **Create New Backup:** Creates a new manual backup of the currently loaded game save for the selected slot.
*   **Rename Backup:** Renames the selected manual backup.
*   **Delete Backup:** Permanently deletes the selected manual backup.

### Mod Management

The "Mod Management" tab is where you control your game modifications.

#### Installing Mods

1.  Click "Install Mod(s)..." at the top right of the tab.
2.  Select one or more `.zip` mod files.
3.  The application will warn you if a mod seems to be packaged incorrectly (e.g., extracting to non-existent directories). You can choose to proceed or cancel.
4.  Mods are extracted directly into your game's root directory.

#### Enabling/Disabling Mods

*   In the "Installed Mods" list, use the **toggle switch** next to each mod name to instantly enable or disable it.
*   Disabling a mod renames its files with a `.disabled` extension, making them inactive without deleting them. Enabling reverses this process.

#### Deleting Mods

*   Click the **"Delete" button** next to a mod name in the list.
*   Confirm deletion to permanently remove the mod's files from your game directory.

#### ⚠️ Modding Warning ⚠️

A prominent red banner on the Mod Management tab serves as an important reminder:
**"Use mods at your own risk. There are no reported bans from modding so far, but we do not know how LEVEL-5 will handle this in the future."**

### Game Utilities

Located at the bottom of the "Mod Management" tab.

#### Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) Bypass

*   **"Bypass Enabled" Switch:** Toggle this on to launch the game without EAC. This is often required for certain types of mods to function correctly.
*   **How it Works:** Enabling the bypass renames the original `EACLauncher.exe` to `EACLauncher.exe.bak` (in the same folder) and renames `NFL1.exe` (the game's main executable) to `EACLauncher.exe`. Disabling reverses this.
*   **Online Play:** If you play with the bypass enabled, you will **only be able to play online with other users who also have the bypass enabled**.

#### Launch Game

*   **"Launch via Steam" Switch:** Toggle this on to launch the game through Steam (recommended for Steam features like overlays). Toggle it off to launch the game directly via its `EACLauncher.exe` file.
*   **"Launch Game" Button:** Clicks this to launch the game using your selected method.

### Game Running Lockout

For your safety and to prevent data corruption:

*   The application detects if `NFL1-Win64-Shipping.exe` is running.
*   When the game is detected, a **"GAME RUNNING - CONTROLS LOCKED"** banner appears in the header.
*   All sensitive actions (loading saves and installing/enabling/disabling/deleting mods) are automatically disabled. You can still browse, rename save slots and create save backups.
*   Controls are re-enabled once the game process is no longer detected.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"Path Invalid" or "Game Not Found":** Ensure your selected game directory is named `FANTASY LIFE i` and contains `EACLauncher.exe`, `NFL1.exe`, and the `Game/Binaries/Win64/NFL1-Win64-Shipping.exe` path.
*   **"TypeError: _path_isdir: path should be string..." at startup:** Delete the `config.json` file in the application's root directory and restart the manager. This usually indicates a malformed config.
*   **Errors on File Operations (e.g., deleting/renaming):** Ensure the game is not running. Files are often in use by the game process.
